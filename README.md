# Acrocar
Acrocar is an indie platformer where you control a car with a grappling hook capable of incredible acrobatic feats. Journey through different environments and swing yourself through all kinds of fun levels, both in 2D and 3D perspectives. The game invites you to venture through a set of levels in the main campaign, where you can unlock new customization options and create your own levels in the level editor. Whether you are a hardcore gamer, a simple indie enthusiast, or something more towards a casual player, Acrocar promises a thrilling experience. 

This project was started as part of the DH2650 Computer Game Design course at KTH in Stockholm.
